    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This creamy Chicken Alfredo is a luxurious pasta dish thatâ€™s rich, indulgent, and perfect for dinner. Tender chicken breast is served over fettuccine noodles, smothered in a velvety Alfredo sauce.</p>
    <p>The dish is easy to prepare, and with a combination of heavy cream, butter, and Parmesan cheese, it creates a silky sauce that pairs perfectly with the chicken and pasta.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 lb fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook the fettuccine pasta according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
